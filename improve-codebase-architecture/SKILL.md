# Improve Codebase Architecture

Explore a codebase like an AI would, surface architectural friction, discover opportunities for improving testability, and propose module-deepening refactors as GitHub issue RFCs.

A **deep module** (John Ousterhout, "A Philosophy of Software Design") has a small interface hiding a large implementation. Deep modules are more testable, more AI-navigable, and let you test at the boundary instead of inside.

## Process

### 1. Explore the codebase

Use the Agent tool to navigate the codebase naturally. Do NOT follow rigid heuristics — explore organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small files?
- Where are modules so shallow that the interface is nearly as complex as the implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules create integration risk in the seams between them?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test?

The friction you encounter IS the signal.

### 2. Present candidate

Present a single deepening opportunity. Show:

- **Cluster**: Which modules/concepts are involved
- **Why they're coupled**: Shared types, call patterns, co-ownership of a concept
- **Dependency category**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the four categories
- **Test impact**: What existing tests would be replaced by boundary tests

Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of this candidate until you reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one.

### 3. Create Github Issue

Create a GitHub issue using `gh issue create`, analysing the candidate and the conversation. Do NOT ask the user to review before creating — just create it and share the URL. Refrain from creating GitHub issue until all the questions are answered.

### Important notes

- Be extremely concise in the entire process. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of clarity.
